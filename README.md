# Customer Request
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

# Description
The purpose of this project was to build a weather application that could retrieve data from a 3rd party api and display weather data from different geographical locations. This project was built to show understanding with local storage, as well as 3rd party api's. This application solves a problem, where someone can go to the application and pull up previously searched cities or type in new cities and show the current forecast as well as the 5 day forecast. During this project, I learned how to use bootstrap, javascript and local storage as well as a 3rd party api from openweathermaps.

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
